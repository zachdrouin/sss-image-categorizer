# Image Categorizer

A simple tool to categorize your images using AI.

## Getting Started

### Installation

No installation required! Just double-click the `ImageCategorizer.command` file to start the application.

### First Time Setup

1. **API Key**: The first time you run the application, you'll need to set up your OpenAI API key.
   - You can get an API key from [OpenAI's website](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
   - Enter your API key in the Settings page

2. **Sample Data**: Use the "Get Sample CSV" button on the welcome page to create a sample CSV file with image URLs.

## How to Use

### Step 1: Prepare Your CSV File

Your CSV file should contain a column with image URLs. The application will analyze these images and categorize them.

### Step 2: Select Categories to Apply to All Images

You can select common categories that apply to most of your images. This makes categorization faster and more consistent.

### Step 3: Process Images

1. Click "Browse" to select your input CSV file
2. Specify where to save the output CSV file
3. Click "Start Processing" to begin

### Step 4: View Results

Once processing is complete, your output CSV file will contain all the original data plus the categorized results.

## Tips

- **Batch Size**: Adjust the batch size to process more images at once. A smaller batch size is more reliable but slower.
- **Mock Mode**: Use mock mode to test the application without making API calls.
- **Start Row**: If processing was interrupted, you can continue from a specific row.
